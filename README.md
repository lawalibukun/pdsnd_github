### Project Title
The Bikeshare project 

### Description

The Bikeshare Project uses Python to analyze data from a bike-sharing app, Motivate in three major cities in the United States of America namely: Chicago, NewYork City and Washington. I have written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I have also written a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Software Used: Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda

Data Sets: All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns: 
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57) 
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53) 
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer) 
 The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns: Gender and Birth Year.

Statistics Evaluated: In this project, I have written code to provide the following information:

Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time): most common month,most common day of week, most common hour of day. Popular stations and trip :most common start station, most common end station, most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
Trip duration: total travel time, average travel time.
User info: counts of each user type counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago) earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago).

How To Run the Data:
Clone the project Prerequisite You must have installed python and libraries like numpy and pandas.
Run the project
Open the terminal
And run python bikeshare_2.py
